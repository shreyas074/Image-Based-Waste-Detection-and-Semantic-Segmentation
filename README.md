# Image-Based-Waste-Detection-and-Semantic-Segmentation
This project implements an image-based waste detection and semantic segmentation pipeline that identifies and segments litter in natural scenes. The system trains a pixel-level segmentation model on the TACO dataset and outputs segmentation masks and visualizations suitable for environmental monitoring and automated waste analysis.
