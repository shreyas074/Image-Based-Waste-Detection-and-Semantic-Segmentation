# Image-Based-Waste-Detection-and-Semantic-Segmentation
This project implements an image-based waste detection and semantic segmentation pipeline that identifies and segments litter in natural scenes. The system trains a pixel-level segmentation model on the TACO dataset and outputs segmentation masks and visualizations suitable for environmental monitoring and automated waste analysis.

# Requirements
The project requires the following Python packages:
Python 3.8+
NumPy
OpenCV
PyTorch
torchvision
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tqdm

You can install dependencies with:
pip install numpy opencv-python torch torchvision matplotlib scikit-learn tqdm

# Dataset
The TACO dataset is an open image dataset for litter detection.
It can be downloaded from the official repository: http://tacodataset.org/
